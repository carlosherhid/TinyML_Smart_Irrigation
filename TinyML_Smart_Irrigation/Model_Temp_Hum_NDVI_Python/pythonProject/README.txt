graficos: In this folder we can find some graphics generated by running the python scripts of the different ML models.

"LinearRegressor_TempHumNDVI_model.py": A script that trains a Linear Regression model with the dataset generated that predicts NDVI anomalies using temperature, NDVI mean, humidity... It also generates a graphic of the prediction and accuracy achieved.

"RandomForest_TempHumNDVI_model.py": A script that trains a RandomForest model with the dataset generated that predicts NDVI anomalies using temperature, NDVI mean, humidity... It also generates a graphic of the prediction and accuracy achieved.

"NN_Model_TFLite_tinyML.py": A script that trains a Neural Network model 10 times with the dataset generated that predicts NDVI anomalies using temperature, NDVI mean, humidity... It also generates a graphic of the prediction and accuracy achieved in the best scenario. After that, the best model is converted in a TFLite model and optimized using quantization in order to reduce the size of the model considerably.

The .csv files are the different datasets used to train the models, one for each weather station.
