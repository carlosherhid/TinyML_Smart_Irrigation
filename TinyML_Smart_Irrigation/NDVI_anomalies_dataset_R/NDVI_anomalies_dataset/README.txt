The folders "code", "colorRamps", "datos", "datosTFG", "paramsTS" contains data and scripts used to gather diferent paramethers. It is important to say that in the folder /datos/TempHum we can find the temperature and humidity raw data that came from different weather stations.

The R script "weather_stations_locations.r" is used to gather the data and the location of each weather station we have.

The R script "Obtain_temp_hum_data.r" is used to gather the temperature and humidity data.

The file "TempHumNDVI.r" is a R script for preparing humidity and temperature data along with NDVI to create a dataset that relates these three variables and determine if humidity and temperature are anomalous with respect to certain NDVI values that we will define as anomalies (very low or high NDVI values for a specific park).

The .csv files are the datasets generated by running the script "TempHumNDVI.r", one file for each weather station.
